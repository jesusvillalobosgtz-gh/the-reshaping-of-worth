# The Transition: From Today to the Mandate

## Phase 1: The World As It Was (Present Day → Year 0)

### Modern Slavery & Hidden Exploitation

**The invisible chains:**
Our world's comfort is built on suffering we don't see—or choose not to see.

#### Supply Chain Slavery

**Cobalt mining (Democratic Republic of Congo):**
- 70% of global cobalt (for smartphones, EVs, laptops) comes from DRC
- **40,000 children** work in artisanal mines
- $1-2 per day wages
- No safety equipment, tunnel collapses common
- Lung disease, poisoning, death
- **Your iPhone exists because a child crawled through toxic dirt.**

**Garment factories (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar):**
- $3/day wages for 14-hour shifts
- Factory fires (Rana Plaza: 1,134 dead)
- Sexual harassment, withheld wages, no bathroom breaks
- **Your $10 t-shirt cost someone their dignity and health.**

**Chocolate industry (Ivory Coast, Ghana):**
- 1.5 million child laborers
- Trafficked from neighboring countries
- Machete injuries, pesticide exposure
- **Your candy bar funded child trafficking.**

**Lithium extraction (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia):**
- Indigenous water rights violated
- Ecosystems destroyed for EV batteries
- Communities displaced for "green" tech
- **Your eco-friendly car killed someone's ancestral land.**

#### The Moral Paradox
- We know this happens
- We have documentation, photos, survivor testimonies
- We keep buying
- Corporations keep profiting
- **Out of sight, out of mind—until the bill comes due.**

## Phase 2: The Famine (Year 0)

### The Preventable Catastrophe

**The trigger:**
- Climate-driven crop failures across East Africa and South Asia
- 12 million at risk of starvation
- UN requests $40 billion emergency aid package

**The response:**
- Initial pledges: $8 billion
- Actual disbursement: $3 billion
- **The gap was closeable. It wasn't closed.**

**Leaked documents reveal:**
- Billionaire coalition lobbied against government aid packages (tax implications)
- Tech CEOs diverted philanthropic funds to AI research instead
- Hedge funds bet against humanitarian bonds (profited from famine)
- Private jets flew 3,000+ trips to luxury destinations during crisis peak

**The death toll:**
- 12.4 million dead over 18 months
- 6.7 million children
- Documented: Every death was preventable with existing wealth redistribution

**The smoking gun:**
> "A single memo surfaces: Tech billionaire to advisor: 'We can't set precedent of bailing out every famine. Slippery slope.'"

## Phase 3: The Reckoning (Year 0-1)

### The Immortal Arrives

**Who/What is the Immortal?**
[Character details to develop in `/characters/`]

- Appears simultaneously in 50 cities during funeral ceremonies for famine victims
- Cannot be killed (attempts made immediately—bullets, explosives, poison—all fail)
- Speaks in all languages simultaneously
- Message: *"You let them die while you hoarded. The hoarding ends now."*

**Initial reactions:**
- Religious fervor (Is this God? A demon? An alien?)
- Government panic (Military strikes fail, detention impossible)
- Billionaire class: Terror, then mobilization

### The Movement Ignites

**Grassroots uprising:**
- Survivors of famine regions lead protests
- Factory workers strike globally (garment, tech, agriculture)
- Veterans refuse deployment to protect corporate assets
- Aid workers publicize: "We watched them die. The money existed."

**Key figures emerge:**
- **The War Vet:** Led convoy protection in resource wars, now knows it was all for corporate profits
- **The Factory Worker:** Escaped Bangladeshi garment slavery, testimony goes viral
- **The Aid Worker:** Quit UN in moral fury, now organizing direct action
- **The Billionaire's Child:** Renounces inheritance, joins movement

**The Immortal's role:**
- Appears at every major protest (unkillable shield for activists)
- Reveals hidden wealth through supernatural means (exposes offshore accounts, shell companies)
- Never leads—inspires others to act
- Faces assassination attempts on live TV—survives, makes assassins look impotent

---

## Phase 4: The Billionaire Resistance (Year 1-2)

### Desperate Measures

**Legal warfare:**
- Constitutional challenges (property rights, due process)
- International courts: "Global wealth cap violates sovereignty"
- Lobbying blitz ($15 billion spent fighting Mandate)

**Public relations campaigns:**
- "Job creators" narrative
- "Innovation dies without incentive" argument
- Funded think tanks produce papers on economic collapse
- Media empires run 24/7 anti-Mandate content

**Capital flight:**
- Offshore asset transfers spike
- Private islands become bunker havens
- Cryptocurrency hoarding
- Attempts to buy nations (small island states offered billions for protection)

**Violence:**
- Mercenary forces hired to suppress protests
- Activist assassinations (failed when Immortal appears)
- Attempted coup in nations supporting Mandate
- **The wealthy will kill to keep wealth—proving the point.**

### The Counter-Movement

**Regular people fight back:**
- Boycotts of billionaire-owned companies (Amazon, Tesla, luxury brands)
- Workers seize factories (co-ops form spontaneously)
- Hackers expose hidden accounts (publish on blockchain)
- Nations begin unilateral wealth seizures

**The Immortal's escalation:**
- Appears at billionaire compounds, publicly shames them
- Survives assassination attempt #47 on live TV, walks through gunfire to embrace shooter
- Message: *"You cannot kill what will not die. You cannot hide what I can see. Submit, or be taken."*

## Phase 5: The Global Vote (Year 3)

### The UN Ratification

**The resolution:**
- 138 nations vote YES
- 15 vote NO (including US initially)
- 30 abstain

**Holdout nations pressured:**
- Economic sanctions from Mandate coalition
- Capital freezes on billionaire assets in non-compliant nations
- Brain drain (skilled workers emigrate to Mandate nations)
- US caves after 6 months (youth revolution, corporate divestment)

**The Mandate becomes international law:**
- $100 million personal wealth cap
- Total financial transparency
- Public execution for evasion/corruption
- Enforcement begins Year 4

---

## Phase 6: The New Reality (Year 4-5, Story Present)

### Implementation

**First wave (Year 4):**
- 2,781 billionaires → 0 billionaires overnight
- $14.2 trillion seized and redistributed
- AI surveillance network activates
- Public blockchain ledger launched

**First execution (Month 3, Year 4):**
- Tech CEO caught with $2 billion in hidden crypto wallets
- Tribunal trial (3 days)
- Execution broadcast live (1.2 billion viewers)
- Moral shockwave: "We've become killers for justice"

**Results by Year 5:**
- Hunger deaths: Down 60%
- Extreme poverty: Down 40%
- Clean water access: Up 40%
- Universal primary education: 85% enrollment (was 62%)
- Child mortality: Down 35%

**But at what cost:**
- 127 executions globally
- Underground wealth networks forming
- Psychological crisis: "Who am I without wealth to chase?"
- Surveillance state accepted as necessary evil
- Freedom vs. security debate intensifies

## Story Themes Emerging from Transition

1. **Out of sight, out of mind → Forced to witness**
   - Slavery hidden in supply chains
   - Famine made undeniable
   - Wealth hoarding becomes visible crime

2. **Slow violence → Sudden justice**
   - Millions died slowly from starvation
   - Executions are quick, brutal, public
   - Which is more violent?

3. **Freedom to harm → Freedom from harm**
   - Old world: Free to hoard while others starve
   - New world: Free from starvation, but not from surveillance
   - What is freedom worth?

4. **Revolution devours its children**
   - Protagonists fight for justice
   - Justice requires becoming executioners
   - Can they live with what they've become?
