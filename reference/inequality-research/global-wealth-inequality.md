## Food Production vs. Hunger

### The Distribution Paradox
> "The world produces enough food for 10 billion people. Hunger is a distribution problem, not a scarcity problem."  
> — UN Food and Agriculture Organization

**Reality:**
- Global food production: Enough for **10 billion people**
- Current population: **8 billion**
- People facing hunger: **828 million**

**What's wasted:**
- **1/3 of all food produced** is wasted (~1.3 billion tons/year)
- Value: **$1 trillion annually**

**The gap:** Money, not food scarcity.

## Philosophical Context

### Historical Wealth Comparisons
- **John D. Rockefeller** (1913): Richest person in history = ~$400 billion (inflation-adjusted)
- **Mansa Musa** (1324): ~$400 billion (estimated)
- **Elon Musk** (2024): ~$250 billion in **liquid, modern economy**

**Key difference:** Today's billionaires exist alongside:
- Real-time global communication
- Documented preventable deaths
- Proven, scalable solutions to poverty

**The moral question:** Previous eras lacked the knowledge and means. We have both.

## Story Application

**Use this data to:**
1. Ground your opening in current reality (pre-Mandate world)
2. Create the "smoking gun" - Evidence that famine was preventable with billionaire wealth
3. Fuel activist/protagonist arguments
4. Show the scale of change the Mandate represents
5. Create moral weight: Every chapter about wealth = reminder of who suffers without it
